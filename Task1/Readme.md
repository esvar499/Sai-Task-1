## Project: Divisibility Checker
## This JavaScript code checks if a given number is divisible by 3.

- How it works:

- Function Definition: The checkdivisiblityBy3 function takes a number as input.
- Divisibility Check: The function uses the modulo operator (%) to check if the remainder of the number divided by 3 is 0.
- Output: If the remainder is 0, the function logs true indicating the number is divisible by 3. 
- Otherwise, it logs false.
Usage:

- Set Numbers: Define the numbers you want to - check (e.g., num1, num2, num3).
- Call the Function: Pass each number to the - checkdivisiblityBy3 function.
